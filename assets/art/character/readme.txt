//HOW TO USE THIS ASSET//
/////////////////////////

Hello! Thank you for purchasing the Classic Character asset pack. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- There are 4 styles for the character:
	- Style 1: Red / blue (default)
	- Style 2: Green / red
	- Style 3: Violet / blue
	- Style 4: Blue / red

- In the root folder, you will find a folder named PNG. This folder contains individual PNGs for each animation for each style.

- In the root folder, you will also find a folder named spritesheet. This folder contains the spritesheets for each style and two choices of metadata format for reading the spritesheet. (Pick the format you like!)

- Recommended animation frame duration is 75ms (0.075s per frame, or 13.33 FPS)

- The dash attack can be used in the air or on the ground. For in-air use, maybe skip to frame 3 when the attack starts, and switch to the fall animation after frame 6.

- If the player uses the dash attack on the ground, you can place the dash_fx animation behind him.

- The 3 punch attacks are designed to be made into a combo. Feel free to skip a couple frames at the beginning or end of the punch animations when the player does a combo to make it more fluid.

- The wall cling sprite is intended to be used to create Mega Man X-style wall climbing.

- You can help make sense of the labels using the following guide, which applies to all my tilesets.

File name definitions:
	- "f000", "f001", "f002", etc.	Filenames with "f" and a number indicate they are a frame of an animation.
	- "A", "B", "C", etc.		"A," "B," "C," and so on indicate different variants of an animation.

Any questions?
Email me at contact@untiedgames.com and I'll try to answer as best I can!
