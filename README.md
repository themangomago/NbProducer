How To Play:

It's always good to start by looking for talents at live events. While searching you can start posting job advertisements in the local newspaper to grow your musician network. When your personal skills are good enough, you can also start writing the first songs and add them to the next album. When the songs on the LP have reached the minimal duration, you can start producing the  album and look for a label. 
But most importantly: Discover the game on your own.
